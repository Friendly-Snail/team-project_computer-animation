# Team Project
>Due: May 4 by 11:59pm

## Overview
In this project, you will create an animation work of your own choosing, with approval of the instructor. The objectives are for you to push your abilities beyond what you have learned in the course, and create something cool. Though the actual structure of this project is not well defined, you must write all the motion-control code for your project by yourself.

As with all the other projects, it is best to start small and spiral up to a large result. Get the framework in place, then add new content once you have it working.  There is a very short development fuse on this project, so please start early, and work efficiently!

Be sure to check out the [FAQ](#FAQ) at the bottom of the assignment.

## Deliverables
### Form Team
Students are will work in teams of 2-3 students for the project. Once you have your team formed, put all of your group member names under one of the empty "Final Project Group" teams under People in the course navigation menu.

### Proposal
Provide an outline of your project direction (submitted here) by **Friday, April 18, 11:59 pm**. The outline should have enough detail so that we can determine if it meets the minimum expectations or if it goes too far to be reasonable by the deadline. 

### Final Project
Develop your animation. The animation may or may not be interactive, but it should be coherent and include an implementation of each of the following:
1. Splines, drawn using Catmull-Rom, uniform B-splines, or another algorithm of your choice (other than Chaikin)
2. Quaternions and SLERPing
3. Shape deformation
4. Skeletal animation
5. Hierarchical modeling/kinematics
6. Physically-based modeling

Use this opportunity to be creative! Don't just shoot for the bare minimum.

Also include a README file that contains the following:
1. A brief description of what you created
2. A description of how each of the above topics are represented in your program
3. Any additional instructions that might be needed to fully use your project (interaction controls, etc.)
4. What challenges you faced in completing the project.
5. What each group member was responsible for designing / developing.

The final project is due **Sunday, May 4, 11:59 pm**! Be prepared to come into class the next day to show off your work.

## Additional Requirements:
* **Canvas Size**: Ensure the canvas is visible without extending beyond the browser window on a typical laptop display.
* **Commands**: Avoid deprecated commands.
* **Code Quality**: As this is a senior-level CS class, I expect you to write clean, professional code with proper indentation, refactoring, and descriptive names. Avoid large commented-out sections.
* **Comments**: Provide clear, explanatory comments, especially before JavaScript functions. Make your code GitHub-ready.

## Submitting Your Work
Make sure to double-check that everything works before submitting. Put all of your files (JavaScript, HTML, etc.) into a folder and zip it. Upload it to Canvas. Do not email your program to the staff or submit it via a third-party cloud storage account.

***Double-check that your project was submitted successfully by following the instructions [in this video](https://echo360.org/media/9766184b-35a4-4c97-9e9e-8d0afcaeae10/public) and/or downloading and opening up your submitted file.***

## Additional Notes:
You may consult any resources, including classmates, the TA, instructor, class text, and other materials, but the code you submit must be your own. ***Plagiarism will result in a 0 for the assignment and a report to the Dean***. You may use class coding examples posted under "Modules."

## FAQ
**Q: Can we use another language/API/etc. (other than WebGL) for the final project?**

Yes, *so long as you observe the following caveats*:

* Everybody in your group must be familiar with or become familiar with the technologies in use. You need to be prepared to show evidence that all group members contributed substantially to the project.

* It needs to be cross-platform or, at the very least, easy for the staff and I to set up without having to jump through hoops to get your project to work. Your README should include any setup instructions we need to know and a brief description of the technologies in use.

* Since the purpose of the project is for you to demonstrate your understanding of the topics in the project description's bulleted list, the implementation of these topics must be coded by you. I don't want you outsourcing them to a third-party library or API. Of course, if it's a library or API you've written yourself, that's fine. I'm also okay with third-party applications for topics not covered in this class (lighting, texturing, shadows, etc.).

* There's a good chance the staff and I will NOT be able to help you with your final project code, since we can't guarantee we'll be familiar with the underlying technologies. You'll be on your own.

**Q: Can we create a few smaller artifacts instead of one big one?**

Yes, but try not to have a separate artifact for EACH of the bulleted topics. I want to see you combine several topics in creative ways.
